        Eiffel Tower, Parisian landmark that is also a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. When the French government was organizing the International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted, and the Centennial Committee accepted that of the noted bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel’s concept of a 300-metre (984-foot) tower built almost entirely of open-lattice wrought iron aroused amazement, skepticism, and no little opposition on aesthetic grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.
        \n\n
        Nothing remotely like the Eiffel Tower had ever been built; it was twice as high as the dome of St. Peter’s in Rome or the Great Pyramid of Giza. In contrast to such older monuments, the tower was erected in only about two years (1887–89), with a small labour force, at slight cost. Making use of his advanced knowledge of the behaviour of metal arch and metal truss forms under loading, Eiffel designed a light, airy, but strong structure that presaged a revolution in civil engineering and architectural design. And, after it opened to the public on May 15, 1889, it ultimately vindicated itself aesthetically.

        A wonderful place for discovering the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, especially in regard to Mediterranean species, and for explaining why their conservation is so necessary and important.
        \n\n
        The aim of our itinerary around L’Aquàrium’s biological collection is to make it an authentic immersion into the Mediterranean itself; a walk around 66 Mediterranean and tropical aquariums, where eleven thousand specimens from over 450 different species coexist. The biggest and most spectacular aquarium is the Oceanarium, where a tunnel over 80 metres long brings visitors close to various types of shark, rays, morays and other species.
        \n\n
        At the beginning of the visit, we are surrounded by the Mediterranean’s surface ecosystems and we then gradually dive deeper and deeper, showing the various habitats, animals and plants that are characteristic of each bathymetric zone, as well as dedicating aquariums to areas of special interest, such as the Medes Islands marine reserve, which has a specially rich biology and biodiversity.

        The newly constructed Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation boasts innovative exhibition galleries and unique attractions, such as an insectarium, and a butterfly vivarium. It seamlessly links with the remaining sections of the American Museum of Natural History, spanning four floors.
        \n\n
        The Davis Family Butterfly Vivarium was inspired by the museum\'s previous seasonal exhibition. This gallery provides a year-round opportunity to immerse yourself in a lush tropical environment featuring 80 different butterfly species.
        \n\n
        Access to the Gilder Center is complimentary with Museum admission, while separate tickets are necessary for entry into the Davis Family Butterfly Vivarium and the immersive experience known as Invisible Worlds.
        \n\n
        Visitors to the museum should make it a point to see the Hayden Planetarium, which is located in the Rose Center for Earth and Space. The planetarium hosts shows that detail cosmic events, such as the formation of stars and planets, as well as shows that describe the celestial bodies viewable from Earth.
